# Github Actions

Github actions can be used to add some automation steps to our github workflow.

Github actions are a set of tools provided by github which allow you to write scripts which are triggered by events within github when interacting with the repo.

For instance a script can be run:

- Manually
- Scheduled
- Automatically with event listeners
